### Data Types
    - *primitives:*
        - **string** - we can store 0 and more characters.
        - **number** -  integers and float numbers between ±(253-1).
        - **bigint** - for big integers.
        - **boolean** - true/false.
        - **null** -  when we need an empty value.
        - **undefined** - for unassigned or undefined values.
        - **symbol** - unique and immutable primitive values.
    - **object** - more complex data structure

With operator typeof we can check a type.
